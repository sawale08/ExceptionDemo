	//This exception occurs when a command completion takes more than the wait time.

	Sometimes test page might not load completely before next command in the program. 
	If WebDriver tries to find an element in the webpage before the page completely loads, 
	then exception ElementNotVisibleException is thrown. To avoid this exception, waits commands are added.

However, if the components don’t load even after the wait, the exception org.openqa.selenium.TimeoutException will be thrown.

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10,TimeUnit.SECONDS) ;

In the above program, an implicit wait of 10 seconds is added. 
If the page www.softwaretestinghelp.com doesn’t load in 10 seconds, then TimeoutException will be thrown.
