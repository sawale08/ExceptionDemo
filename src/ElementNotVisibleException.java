 ElementNotVisibleException class is a subclass of ElementNotInteractableException class. 
 This exception is thrown when WebDriver tries to perform an action on an invisible web element, 
 which cannot be interacted with. That is, the web element is in a hidden state.
 
  if the type of button with id ‘submit’ is ‘hidden’ in HTML, org.openqa.selenium.ElementNotVisibleException will be thrown.
  
  There are two ways to do this. We can either use wait for the element to get completely.
